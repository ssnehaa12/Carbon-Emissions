# Carbon-Emissions
Our chosen field of interest is the impact of renewable energy adoption 
on reducing global carbon emissions. This topic is intriguing due to our passion for sustainable 
development and climate change mitigation. Its significance is pivotal within the broader scope 
because the shift towards renewable energy is a critical tactic in the fight against climate 
change, diminishing dependence on fossil fuels, and advocating for a sustainable future. 
Understanding the dynamics of this transition and its effects on carbon emissions can help 
inform policy decisions and public awareness, contributing to global efforts to limit global 
warming and its associated risks. 

This project examines the growth of renewable energy sources within the global 
energy sector, analyzing trends, challenges, and prospects. It highlights the increasing share of 
renewables in power generation, driven by technological advancements and policy support. 
The study also discusses the potential of renewables to significantly reduce carbon emissions 
and outlines the barriers to their adoption, including economic, technical, and infrastructure 
challenges. 

Provides a fundamental understanding of the state of renewable energy 
adoption and its potential impact on carbon emissions. It emphasizes the importance of 
renewables in achieving emission reduction targets and the need for comprehensive policy 
frameworks to overcome existing barriers. This knowledge is instrumental in framing our 
research questions, as it underscores the direct link between renewable energy expansion and 
carbon emission trends. Furthermore, the discussion on challenges presents an avenue to 
explore the effectiveness of different technologies in accelerating the transition to renewables.
